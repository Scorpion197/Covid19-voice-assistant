# Covid19-web-scrapper-voice-assistant

Covid19 web scrapper about number of deaths/total cases in every country in the world.
Here is the url of the website where i got the informations : https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
Concerning the voice assistant , I used Google Speech Recognition API to process the audio as well as answer the user. 
The format of a question should be the follwoing : 'How many cases/deaths are there in COUNTRY' otherwise it will output an error.
